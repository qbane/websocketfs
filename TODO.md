- [x] fix all typescript errors

- [ ] get rid of all the #if macro preprocess comments (maybe grunt used them). We can solve these problems for the web later, e.g., using polyfills or better code.

- [ ] enable noUnusedLocals

- [ ] enable noUnusedParameters

- [ ] enable strictNullChecks

- [ ] require require's to use static import syntax instead

- [ ] upgrade to newest ws module.

- [ ] eliminate all use of `var`

- [ ] promote the node-fuse stuff to be part of the main library instead of an example

- [ ] there are a bunch of TODO's in the code still!
