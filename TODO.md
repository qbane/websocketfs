- [ ] upgrade to newest ws module.
- [ ] redo all logging to use the debug module \(and add more logging\)
- [ ] get rid of all the #if macro preprocess comments \(maybe grunt used them\). We can solve these problems for the web later, e.g., using polyfills or better code.
- [ ] require require's to use static import syntax instead
- [ ] eliminate use of `var`
- [ ] promote the node\-fuse stuff to be part of the main library instead of an example
- [ ] there are a bunch of TODO's in the code still!
- [x] fix all typescript errors
- [x] enable noUnusedLocals
- [x] enable noUnusedParameters
- [x] enable strictNullChecks
